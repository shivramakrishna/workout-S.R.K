   <center> <h1>WORKOUT ROUTINES
    THE BEST FULL GYM CHEST WORKOUT
    Add inches to your chest fast with this high-volume muscle-building workout.</h1></center>
   <p>
    Bodybuilders of the ’70s liked to stretch and flex the muscles they were training between sets, believing it enhanced growth. What they stumbled upon has been refined into a formal muscle-building protocol by Hany Rambod, trainer to many of today’s top champions including Mr. Olympia winners Phil Heath and Jay Cutler. Here, we use his FST-7 method to pack new meat on your pecs. It’s the easiest way to build a more imposing upper body and transform the way you look in everything from t-shirts to sweatshirts. Plus, if it works for guys like Magic Mike‘s Joe Manganiello and X-Men’s Hugh Jackman, it’ll work for you.

HOW IT WORKS
After pounding the pectorals with some conventional chest exercises, we finish them off with FST-7, which stands for “Fascial Stretch Training” done for seven sets. Fascial refers to the fascia, the web-like connective tissue that envelopes each muscle. Picture that thin layer that covers a skinless chicken breast—that’s the same stuff. By stretching the fascia, you create more room for the muscles to grow. By flexing, you’ll drive more nutrient-filled blood into the muscles to enhance gains.

<center><h1>The Best Chest Workout </h1></center>
<p>
    There are plenty of articles out there that will claim to show you the best chest workout routine of all time. Trust me, I’ve seen them, and the vast majority are crap.

That’s why I’ve decided to do something a little different in this article. Actually, I’m going to do three things:

First, I’m going to show you the WORST chest workout routine that men typically use.
Then, I’m going to show you 9 factors that actually make a chest workout effective.
And finally, I’m going to provide you with some example workouts that put it all together.
Let the fun begin…
</p>
<center><h1>Bodybuilding Bullshit

</h1></center>
<p>

    This is the typical high volume, low frequency “blast the crap out of your muscles” bodybuilding nonsense you commonly see being done by steroid-using bodybuilders. Natural guys will then see this and assume “these bodybuilders train this way and they’re huge, so clearly I should train this way to get just as huge!” which unfortunately ignores the fact that their aforementioned steroid use makes everything effective, including things that are ineffective for us natural trainees. 

</p>
<center><h1>Train Your Chest 2-3 Times Per Week</h1></center>
<p>All research looking at training frequency shows that a higher frequency (2-3 times per week) is more effective than a lower frequency (once per week), and real-world experience confirms it. Which means instead of this once-per-week frequency where you only hit your chest every Monday, you should hit your chest 2 or 3 times per week. How do you do this, you ask? Simple. Instead of a low frequency body part split that involves having a single “chest day,” you should use a Full Body split, Upper/Lower split, or Push/Pull/Legs split.</p>
<center><h1>Do 1-3 Chest Exercises Per Workout</h1></center>
<p>Rather than doing every chest exercise in existence, stick with 1-3 chest exercises per workout. More specifically, 1 exercise if you’re using a full body split, 2 exercises if you’re using an upper/lower split, and 2-3 exercises if you’re using a push/pull/legs split.

       <p> 6. Summary</p>
       <center><h1>Foods To Add To Your Gym Diet Plan</h1></center>
       <p>There are mainly three macronutrients that play a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions and even promote changes in strength and composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats and it is essential that we consume all three macros in ample quantities to optimize progress accordingly.</p>
   <p>Let’s see what are the vital nutrients you must include in your gym diet plan for muscle gain and weight loss.</p>
   <center><h1>Protein</h1></center>
   <p>This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.</p>

<center><h1>Fats</h1></center>
<p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.</p>
<p>Examples of unsaturated fat foods include avocados, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), oils (olive, peanut), and soy products that you can include in your gym diet plan.</p>
<center><h1>Gym Diet – Pre-Workout Foods</h1></center>
<p>Focus on carbohydrates as all pre-workout meals or snacks to provide the body with energy to last the full session. So, if energy levels are sub-optimal, then performance will suffer and have a consequent impact on our rate of adaptation.</p>
<p>Next, focus on simple carbohydrates in a gym diet plan as they take less time to digest and provide the body with energy. It may even be recommended to consume some simple carbs during a workout to maintain energy levels and performance.</p>
<p>For example, white bread, jam, granola, cereal, sports drinks, and fruit are all viable options for a pre-workout, energy-boosting snack.</p>
<p>While the focus should predominantly be on carbohydrates, nevertheless it is also important to consume some protein prior to stepping into the gym. So, to support muscle recovery and growth, protein levels should be maintained at a high level throughout each day.</p>
<center><h1>Gym Diet – Post-Workout Foods</h1></center>
<p>The purpose of post-workout nutrition is two-fold, firstly, to promote muscle recovery and secondly to replenish energy. Therefore, the focus should once again be on consuming good quality protein and carb foods.</p>
<p>As previously reflected on, the stress of training causes micro tears to occur to the muscles that must be repaired. So, consuming protein will cause a process known as muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to occur accordingly. It will also begin the repairing process and prevent muscle breakdown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a widely held belief that protein timing is extremely important for maximizing growth. However, a number of recently based studies have indicated that total daily protein intake is of greater importance than the timing.

    Therefore, High-protein foods such as lean beef, chicken, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, seeds, quinoa, and nuts should be prioritized. Also, protein supplements, like protein shakes and bars, can serve as a convenient tool for effectively boosting protein intake.</p>
<p>Also for a proper Gym diet plan, it is advised to consume protein and carbs together as this will have the most pronounced impact on recovery. Thus, this enhances protein and glycogen (energy) synthesis. Moreover, a ratio of 3:1 carb to protein is prescribed for optimizing recovery.</p>

<center><h1>Nutrition Do’s and Don’ts</h1></center>
<p>This final section will highlight a number of do’s and don’ts to help keep you on the right track with your nutrition for optimal results of your gym diet plan.</p>
<h1>Do’s:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Consume all 3 macronutrients</li> </p>
  <li> Ensure that you are eating a wide range of fruit and vegetables for comprehensive consumption of vitamins and minerals</li></p>
    <li> Especially choose complex carbs over simple carbs</li>
   <li>Ensure that you are consuming protein regularly throughout the day</li>
   <li>Consume unsaturated fats over saturated and trans fats</li> 
   <li> Moderate your consumption of produce that will negatively impact health and gym progress</li>
    <li>Maintain hydration levels accordingly</li> </ul>
    <h1>Don’t:</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Cut a macronutrient from your diet as all are required for specific functions</li>
<li>Skip meals, especially in the lead up to or after a workout</li>
<li>Eat a “heavy” complex carb meal too close to beginning a workout</li>
<li>Rely too heavily on simple carbs to fuel performance</li>
<li>Make poor nutritional choices for the sake of gaining calorie</li>
</ul>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In brief, it is now clear that there are many aspects of nutrition that must be considered when it comes to optimizing gym progress and to generally improving health.</p>
<p>Thus, following the Gym Diet plan and recommendations outlined in this article will allow you to make substantial changes to your performance and health.</p>
