   <center> <h1>THE ULTIMATE SHOULDER WORKOUT GUIDE</h1></center>
   <p>A lot of people ‘forget’ to train shoulders, don’t train them often enough, or train them improperly.

    As much as shoulders may not be at the top of your list of favorite muscles to train, it’s crucial that you not ignore them! Plus, a set of big boulder shoulders makes a very impressive contribution to your overall physique.
    
    In this complete guide to shoulder workouts, I’ll give you an overview of the shoulder muscles, tell you why they’re so important and give you the best shoulder exercises and workout tips regardless of what equipment you have available to you so that you can create the best shoulder programs for you.
    
    This step-by-step guide is broken down into sections so you can easily find exactly what you’re looking for to build strong shoulders. I’ll also be answering all the most common questions related to shoulders and shoulder workouts.
    
    Here are some of the topics that I’ll cover in this shoulder strength training guide:</p>
 


 
<center><h1>1) SHOULDER MUSCLES ANATOMY </h1></center>
<p>The deltoid muscle is comprised of 3 deltoid heads: the front delt head (anterior deltoid), middle delt head (lateral deltoid) and rear delt head (posterior deltoid).

    I’ll use my handy Muscle Markers to show you each of the deltoid heads.
    
    You can refer back to this section if needed, because I’ll be showing you different shoulder-specific exercises to target each of these areas, and some that target all three.
    
</p>
<center><h1>2) WHY ARE SHOULDER WORKOUTS IMPORTANT?</h1></center>
<p>Shoulders are a muscle that people tend to undertrain, train incorrectly or ignore altogether.

    If that sounds like you, you’re making a big mistake by omitting shoulder programs from your training!
    
    Training shoulders is critical for three important reasons:</p>
    <p><h3> 1. Well-developed shoulders enhance the appearance of your upper body and create a balanced look to the physique.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>2. Strengthening the muscles around the shoulder joint helps maintain good shoulder health. The shoulders are often chronically weak due to undertraining, so having strong shoulders supports the rotational nature of the shoulder joint in all the activities of daily living as well as in your strength training workouts. This will also help prevent potential shoulder injury.</h3></p>
<p><h3>3. Shoulders can be trained with lighter weight and a variety of different types of equipment, which allows for flexibility to train at home or on the road.</h3></p>

   <center> <h1>3) HOW TO GET BIGGER SHOULDERS</h1></center>
<p><h3>If you’re trying to develop big broad shoulders, you’re going to have to let go of the ego.</h3></p>
<p>When it comes to deltoid training, that old adage of ‘lift big, get big’ doesn’t ring true. To build strong beefy shoulders, you’re going to have to pick up the light dumbbells.</p><br><br>
<p>The heavy weights will still have their place in your shoulder development, but light weights are where it’s at for developing bigger delts.</p><br><br>
<p>Why is that the case?</p><br><br>
<p>Heavy compound lifts aren’t ideal when it comes to building muscular shoulders. That’s because the deltoid muscles receive so much assistance from other muscle groups in the upper body when doing big lifts. To move all those pounds of weight, the triceps, chest muscles, back, abdominal muscles and legs kick in. There will be some momentum involved as well.</p><br><br>

    THE ULTIMATE SHOULDER WORKOUT GUIDE</p>
    A lot of people ‘forget’ to train shoulders, don’t train them often enough, or train them improperly.
    
    As much as shoulders may not be at the top of your list of favorite muscles to train, it’s crucial that you not ignore them! Plus, a set of big boulder shoulders makes a very impressive contribution to your overall physique.

    Here are some of the topics that I’ll cover in this shoulder strength training guide:

  <p>  3) HOW TO GET BIGGER SHOULDERS</p>

   <p> 6) WHAT IS THE BEST DUMBBELL SHOULDER WORKOUT?</p>
    <p>7) HOW CAN YOU DO A SHOULDER WORKOUT AT HOME?</p><br>
   
<center><h1>HOW TO DO IT THE OVERHEAD BAND PRESS:</h1></center>
<p>(1) 1For the overhead shoulder band press anchor the resistance band to something in front of you just lower than chest level.</p><br>
<p>(2) Take the resistance band in both hands and walk yourself back a few feet.</p><br>
   <p>(3) Begin to press upward with both hands to overhead position.</p> <br>
   <p>(4) Do two sets of 15 repetitions with a three second hold. Try to do very deliberate high-quality repetitions.</p><br>
   <center><h1>WHAT MAKES IT EFFECTIVE:</h1></center>
   
   <p>In this variation, the resistance isn’t coming from the ground up, like it would in a typical dumbbell shoulder press or barbell shoulder press. The elastic band is pulling you toward the front, so you’ll have to activate the muscles of the rear delt and the rotator cuff muscles. We need the support of the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder stability to do overhead activities, so it’s important that we warm it up.</p>
</p>
<center><h1>FOUNDATIONAL STRENGTH SHOULDER EXERCISES</h1></center>
<p>While it’s important to use targeted shoulder exercises with lighter weights to zero in on these muscles, foundational moves are just as important.</p><br>
<p>For this, one of the best compound shoulder exercises is the Barbell Overhead Press, because we’re able to create overload and scale to heavier weights.</p><br>
<p>If we perform the Banded Overhead Press followed by the Barbell Overhead Press we’re also using neuromuscular reeducation to enforce what we established with the banded activation exercise in the barbell exercise.</p><br>
<center><h1>4) WHAT ARE THE BEST SHOULDER EXERCISES?</h1></center>
<p><h3>There are a wide range of exercises to choose from, but the best shoulder exercises for you will depend a lot on what type of equipment you have available.
</h3></p><br>
<p>I want to help make sure you’re training this often-neglected muscle group, so in this section and the ones that follow I’ll show you some of the most effective exercises you can do to build bigger shoulders depending on the tools you’ve got.</p><br>
<p><h2>HOW TO DO RELAY RAISES:</h2></p>
<p> 1. Start with feet shoulder width apart, and slightly staggered in front of a cable pulley with your body facing away from the weight machine, grabbing a cable handle with an overhand grip
</p><br>
<p>2. Hold the attachment with one hand, palm facing forward</p><br>
<p>3. Use the shoulder muscle to push forward and then slowly lower the weight to return to starting position.</p><br>
<p><h2>WHAT MAKES IT EFFECTIVE:</h2></p>
<p>The Relay Raise is one of my favorite cable exercises because it’s among the best pressing exercises you can do if you have access to a cable machine.</p>

       <p> 6. Summary</p>
       <center><h1>Foods To Add To Your Gym Diet Plan</h1></center>
       <p>There are mainly three macronutrients that play a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions and even promote changes in strength and composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats and it is essential that we consume all three macros in ample quantities to optimize progress accordingly.</p>
   <p>Let’s see what are the vital nutrients you must include in your gym diet plan for muscle gain and weight loss.</p>
   <center><h1>Protein</h1></center>
   <p>This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.</p>

<center><h1>Fats</h1></center>
<p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.</p>
<p>Examples of unsaturated fat foods include avocados, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), oils (olive, peanut), and soy products that you can include in your gym diet plan.</p>
<center><h1>Gym Diet – Pre-Workout Foods</h1></center>
<p>Focus on carbohydrates as all pre-workout meals or snacks to provide the body with energy to last the full session. So, if energy levels are sub-optimal, then performance will suffer and have a consequent impact on our rate of adaptation.</p>
<p>Next, focus on simple carbohydrates in a gym diet plan as they take less time to digest and provide the body with energy. It may even be recommended to consume some simple carbs during a workout to maintain energy levels and performance.</p>
<p>For example, white bread, jam, granola, cereal, sports drinks, and fruit are all viable options for a pre-workout, energy-boosting snack.</p>
<p>While the focus should predominantly be on carbohydrates, nevertheless it is also important to consume some protein prior to stepping into the gym. So, to support muscle recovery and growth, protein levels should be maintained at a high level throughout each day.</p>
<center><h1>Gym Diet – Post-Workout Foods</h1></center>
<p>The purpose of post-workout nutrition is two-fold, firstly, to promote muscle recovery and secondly to replenish energy. Therefore, the focus should once again be on consuming good quality protein and carb foods.</p>
<p>As previously reflected on, the stress of training causes micro tears to occur to the muscles that must be repaired. So, consuming protein will cause a process known as muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to occur accordingly. It will also begin the repairing process and prevent muscle breakdown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a widely held belief that protein timing is extremely important for maximizing growth. However, a number of recently based studies have indicated that total daily protein intake is of greater importance than the timing.

    Therefore, High-protein foods such as lean beef, chicken, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, seeds, quinoa, and nuts should be prioritized. Also, protein supplements, like protein shakes and bars, can serve as a convenient tool for effectively boosting protein intake.</p>
<p>Also for a proper Gym diet plan, it is advised to consume protein and carbs together as this will have the most pronounced impact on recovery. Thus, this enhances protein and glycogen (energy) synthesis. Moreover, a ratio of 3:1 carb to protein is prescribed for optimizing recovery.</p>

<center><h1>Nutrition Do’s and Don’ts</h1></center>
<p>This final section will highlight a number of do’s and don’ts to help keep you on the right track with your nutrition for optimal results of your gym diet plan.</p>
<h1>Do’s:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Consume all 3 macronutrients</li> </p>
  <li> Ensure that you are eating a wide range of fruit and vegetables for comprehensive consumption of vitamins and minerals</li></p>
    <li> Especially choose complex carbs over simple carbs</li>
   <li>Ensure that you are consuming protein regularly throughout the day</li>
   <li>Consume unsaturated fats over saturated and trans fats</li> 
   <li> Moderate your consumption of produce that will negatively impact health and gym progress</li>
    <li>Maintain hydration levels accordingly</li> </ul>
    <h1>Don’t:</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Cut a macronutrient from your diet as all are required for specific functions</li>
<li>Skip meals, especially in the lead up to or after a workout</li>
<li>Eat a “heavy” complex carb meal too close to beginning a workout</li>
<li>Rely too heavily on simple carbs to fuel performance</li>
<li>Make poor nutritional choices for the sake of gaining calorie</li>
</ul>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In brief, it is now clear that there are many aspects of nutrition that must be considered when it comes to optimizing gym progress and to generally improving health.</p>
<p>Thus, following the Gym Diet plan and recommendations outlined in this article will allow you to make substantial changes to your performance and health.</p>
