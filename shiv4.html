   <p> Step 3: Continue moving the barbell until the biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height. Hold this position for a second and then squeeze your biceps.</p>
    
   <p> Step 4: Bring the barbell back to the starting position. Do 3-4 sets hitting around 10-12 reps. If you are using heavier weight do 3-4 sets hitting around 4-8 repetitions.</p>

Have someone hand you the bar which is preferable or grab the bar from the front bar rest provided by most preacher benches. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar.</p>

   <p>Step 2: With the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold the E-Z curl bar at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.</p>
    
   <p> Step 3: As you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps are fully stretched</p>
    
   <p> Step 4: As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height. Squeeze the biceps hard and hold this position for a second</p>

       <p> 6. Summary</p>
       <center><h1>Foods To Add To Your Gym Diet Plan</h1></center>
       <p>There are mainly three macronutrients that play a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions and even promote changes in strength and composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats and it is essential that we consume all three macros in ample quantities to optimize progress accordingly.</p>
   <p>Let’s see what are the vital nutrients you must include in your gym diet plan for muscle gain and weight loss.</p>
   <center><h1>Protein</h1></center>
   <p>This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.</p>

<center><h1>Fats</h1></center>
<p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.</p>
<p>Examples of unsaturated fat foods include avocados, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), oils (olive, peanut), and soy products that you can include in your gym diet plan.</p>
<center><h1>Gym Diet – Pre-Workout Foods</h1></center>
<p>Focus on carbohydrates as all pre-workout meals or snacks to provide the body with energy to last the full session. So, if energy levels are sub-optimal, then performance will suffer and have a consequent impact on our rate of adaptation.</p>
<p>Next, focus on simple carbohydrates in a gym diet plan as they take less time to digest and provide the body with energy. It may even be recommended to consume some simple carbs during a workout to maintain energy levels and performance.</p>
<p>For example, white bread, jam, granola, cereal, sports drinks, and fruit are all viable options for a pre-workout, energy-boosting snack.</p>
<p>While the focus should predominantly be on carbohydrates, nevertheless it is also important to consume some protein prior to stepping into the gym. So, to support muscle recovery and growth, protein levels should be maintained at a high level throughout each day.</p>
<center><h1>Gym Diet – Post-Workout Foods</h1></center>
<p>The purpose of post-workout nutrition is two-fold, firstly, to promote muscle recovery and secondly to replenish energy. Therefore, the focus should once again be on consuming good quality protein and carb foods.</p>
<p>As previously reflected on, the stress of training causes micro tears to occur to the muscles that must be repaired. So, consuming protein will cause a process known as muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to occur accordingly. It will also begin the repairing process and prevent muscle breakdown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a widely held belief that protein timing is extremely important for maximizing growth. However, a number of recently based studies have indicated that total daily protein intake is of greater importance than the timing.

    Therefore, High-protein foods such as lean beef, chicken, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, seeds, quinoa, and nuts should be prioritized. Also, protein supplements, like protein shakes and bars, can serve as a convenient tool for effectively boosting protein intake.</p>
<p>Also for a proper Gym diet plan, it is advised to consume protein and carbs together as this will have the most pronounced impact on recovery. Thus, this enhances protein and glycogen (energy) synthesis. Moreover, a ratio of 3:1 carb to protein is prescribed for optimizing recovery.</p>

<center><h1>Nutrition Do’s and Don’ts</h1></center>
<p>This final section will highlight a number of do’s and don’ts to help keep you on the right track with your nutrition for optimal results of your gym diet plan.</p>
<h1>Do’s:</h1>
<ul>

  <li> Ensure that you are eating a wide range of fruit and vegetables for comprehensive consumption of vitamins and minerals</li></p>
    <li> Especially choose complex carbs over simple carbs</li>
   <li>Ensure that you are consuming protein regularly throughout the day</li>
   <li>Consume unsaturated fats over saturated and trans fats</li> 
   <li> Moderate your consumption of produce that will negatively impact health and gym progress</li>
    <li>Maintain hydration levels accordingly</li> </ul>
    <h1>Don’t:</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Cut a macronutrient from your diet as all are required for specific functions</li>
<li>Skip meals, especially in the lead up to or after a workout</li>
<li>Eat a “heavy” complex carb meal too close to beginning a workout</li>
<li>Rely too heavily on simple carbs to fuel performance</li>
